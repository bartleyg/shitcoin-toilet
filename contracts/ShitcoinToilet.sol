Contract receives ERC20 tokens and mints equal amount ðŸ’©coin in return
This requires 2 separate transactions by user
Transaction 1: user does approve(address thisContract, uint amt) transaction on the token in web3
Transaction 2: once mined user calls this contract toilet(address token, uint amt) which:
  1. checks token.allowance(address msg.sender, address thisContract) matches amt
  2. checks token.balanceOf(address msg.sender) >= amt (is this checked already in approve?)
  3. token.transferFrom(address msg.sender, address thisContract, uint amt)
  4. mints ERC777 ðŸ’©coin in amount equal to that received by user's token
